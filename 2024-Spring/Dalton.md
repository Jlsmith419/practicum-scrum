# Dalton Scrum Notes

## Week 5

This week I completed the coding for experiment 1 of my Dissertation (Woo!). I took some of this week to add the haptics functionality to that project for a related side project and began training my Undergrad RA to run that side project. 

### Goals:
- Have *Proposal* Date Scheduled
- Have RA fully trained to run haptics project independently
- Apply to present at ICPA (**02/15**)

### Other things going on:

- Statistics have been handed off to Emily for Agent vs. Environment Project
- Two events to organise for PEWS (Public Engagement with Science)
- Grievance Review Committee service likely to continue until April
