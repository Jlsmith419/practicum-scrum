I just finished week 2 of 6 of reading period for the MQE. Overall, this week went better than last week. I read more, and got a better grasp on the way the week will go. Below are the readings I got through this week:
- Adler et al. (2018)
- Cheung & Slavin (2012)
- Katz & Assor (2007)
- Wigfield et al. (2016)

    - chapter 2
    - chapter 3
