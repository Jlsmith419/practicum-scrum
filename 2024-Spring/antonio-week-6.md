# Antonio's Week 6(?) Updates
## Matlab to R
- Updated my fractal dimension calculator in Github with help from Stack Exchange.
  - Works pretty well. Might be worth making into a package.
- Working on getting the hang of the cusp catastrophe package in R for a future study.

## App Idea
- No progress. Still need some help figuring out where/how to start.
- Will be meeting with undergrad comp sci friend at some point.
